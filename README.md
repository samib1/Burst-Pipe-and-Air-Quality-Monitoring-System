# Burst-Pipe-and-Air-Quality-Monitoring-System
## Note
This was my final year project at university of manitoba ECE 4600: Group 12 IoT burst pipe and air quality monitoring system. <br> I was tasked with creating the mobile application that connects to a real time google firebase built by [Raul Gonzales](https://github.com/raul-gonzales/ECE4600)

## Overview Of Project
The goal of the project was to design an IoT based Burst Pipe Detection and Air Quality Monitoring System that automatically detects and remove particulate matter in the air while also providing a platform for detecting and responding to potential water leaks in the home. Additionally, the system will provide the user with a method for monitoring both subsystems from a mobile application. The platform comprises of two subsystems but can be expanded to include other home automation subsystems.

## Overview Of The Mobile Application
To allow the user to monitor and control their home monitoring systems namely the water supply line for burst pipe and air quality. Choose using a mobile phone application over a web application mainly because the user would have real-time access to their home system and have access to phones 24/7. Hence a mobile phone application is the best medium with which the user could monitor and control their systems.
